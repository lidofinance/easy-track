# Abstract

**Easy Track** is a type of voting where a motion is considered to have passed if the minimum objections threshold hasn’t been reached.

**EasyTrack contract** is the main contract, which implements the Easy Track voting mechanism. EasyTrack contract inherits from several OpenZeppelin contracts:

- [AccessControl](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0c4de6721d9668d7b5b2c5a9400fd0b2a5e8de90/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol) - to restrict access to some methods only to a set of admin addresses. **Admin of Easy Track** - is an address granted with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. By default, Admin of Easy Track will be Aragon's Voting address.
- [Pausable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0c4de6721d9668d7b5b2c5a9400fd0b2a5e8de90/contracts/security/Pausable.sol) - to implement the ability to freeze enactment and creation of motions. Pausing allowed for addresses with role `PAUSE_ROLE` and unpausing – for addresses with role `UNPAUSE_ROLE`. By default, both roles are assigned to the Admin of Easy Track.

Easy Track is strongly inspired by Aragon's Voting and based on Aragon's [EVMScripts](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref#evmscripts-1) concept. Execution of EVMScripts is performed by standalone EVMScriptExecutor contract, which can be called only by EasyTrack contract. Implementation of EVMScriptExecutor used in EasyTrack contract delegates execution of EVMScripts to Aragon's [CallsScript](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/evmscript/executors/CallsScript.sol#L25) executor.

As opposed to Aragon's Voting, EasyTrack contract doesn't allow to pass EVMScripts directly, and uses standalone **EVMScript factory** contracts to create EVMScripts. **EVMScript factory** - is a special contract, which implements [IEVMScriptFactory](#ievmscriptfactory) interface. Each EVMScript factory has to be registered in the EasyTrack contract before it can be used for motion creation. Registration of EVMScript factory contracts is allowed only to Admins of Easy Track.

To enhance the security of Easy Track, each EVMScript factory has its own **Permissions** set when a new EVMScript factory is being registered in the EasyTrack contract. **Permissions** is a list of tuples `(address, bytes4)` encoded into a bytes representation. Each tuple `(address, bytes4)` describes a method allowed to be called by EVMScript generated by the corresponding EVMScript factory. EasyTrack validates each EVMScript to satisfy permissions and reverts transaction if EVMScript tries to call a method not listed in its permissions.

EasyTrack contract stores motion data in the following struct:

```solidity=
struct Motion {
    uint256 id;
    address evmScriptFactory;
    address creator;
    uint256 duration;
    uint256 startDate;
    uint256 snapshotBlock;
    uint256 objectionsThreshold;
    uint256 objectionsAmount;
    bytes32 evmScriptHash;
}
```

EasyTrack contract doesn't store EVMScripts on-chain but only keccak256 hash of it. On enactment of motion, EasyTrack contract recreates EVMScript using corresponding EVMScript factory and compares the hash of recreated EVMScript with the stored hash; if it matches, EasyTrack contract passes EVMScript to EVMScriptsExecutor and reverts in other cases.

The lifecycle of motion in the easy track voting might be described as follows:

1. A motion can be started by calling `createMotion(address _evmScriptFactory, bytes _evmScriptFactoryCallData)` function on EasyTrack contract.
2. Upon motion creation, EasyTrack contract calls `createEVMScript(msg.sender, _evmScriptFactoryCallData)` function on the corresponding EVMScript factory contract passing all the data required to generate a motion enactment EVMScript.
3. EVMScript factory smart contract generates the script and returns it to the EasyTrack contract.
4. EasyTrack contract conducts the motion according to the motion settings (i.e. motion duration, objections threshold, and max active motions limit).
5. As soon as the motion duration expires, it becomes possible to enact the motion via `enactMotion(uint256 _motionId, bytes evmScriptFactoryCallData)`.
6. To enact the motion, the EasyTrack contract recreates EVMScript via the corresponding EVMScript factory contract and passes it to the `EVMScriptExecutor` smart contract.

Additionally to the creating, enacting, and objecting motions, EasyTrack contract allows the creator of the motion to cancel it at any time while it wasn't enacted. It might be convenient in some cases: passed wrong data to EVMScript factory on motion creation or inability to enact motion due to the changed state of outer contracts etc.

Addresses with the role `CANCEL_ROLE` have the right to cancel any motions. EasyTrack contract has two methods for it: to cancel a list of motions or all motions at once. By default, `CANCEL_ROLE` is granted to Aragon's Voting address.

To prevent motion spamming, EasyTrack contract limits the count of active motions. By default, the limit is 12 active motions. This value can be changed in the future by the Admin of Easy Track. But the new value can't be greater than 24.

Default enact delay for motions equals 48 hours. It might be changed by the Admin of Easy Track, but the new value can't be less than 48 hours.

Default objections threshold equals 0.5%. It might be changed by the Admin of Easy Track, but the new value can't be greater than 5%.

# Core Contracts

As it was mentioned above, EasyTrack is the main contract in the implementation of the Easy Track voting model.
To improve the readability and simplicity of the EasyTrack contract, groups of methods and associated variables are moved to standalone contracts:

- [MotionSettings](#motionsettings) - keeps functionality to set objections threshold, max amount of active motions, and time required to allow motion to be enacted.
- [EVMScriptFactoriesRegistry](#evmscriptfactoriesregistry) - keeps functionality to add/remove EVMScriptFactories and create EVMScripts.

Such separation helps to keep in EasyTrack contract only the data and methods related to Easy Track logic directly. The whole inheritance graph can be seen in the picture below.

Contains main logic of Easy Track. Inherits from `Pausable`, `AccessControl`, `MotionSettings` and `EVMScriptFactoriesRegistry`.

### Storage Variables

Below variables used in primary Easy Track actions:

- **`Motion[] motions`** - list of active motions.
- **`IMiniMeToken governanceToken`** - address of governance token. Token has to implement balance history interface of [MiniMeToken](https://github.com/Giveth/minime#balance-history-is-registered-and-available-to-be-queried). Only holders of this token can send objections.Only holders of this token can submit objections.
- **`IEVMScriptExecutor evmScriptExecutor`** - address of EVMScriptExecutor
- **`mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) objections`** - stores if motion with given id has been objected from given address.

### Constructor

#### constructor(address \_governanceToken, address \_admin, uint256 \_motionDuration, uint256 \_motionsCountLimit, uint256 \_objectionsThreshold)

Calls parent constructors: `EVMScriptFactoriesRegistry(_admin)` and `MotionSettings(_admin, _motionDuration, _motionsCountLimit, _objectionsThreshold)`, sets value for `governanceToken` variable, grants roles `DEFAULT_ADMIN_VALUE`, `PAUSE_ROLE`, `UNPAUSE_ROLE`, `CANCEL_ROLE` to `_admin` address.

### Methods

#### function createMotion(address \_evmScriptFactory, bytes memory \_evmScriptCallData) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 \_newMotionId)

Creates new motion and returns the id of created motion. Passed `_evmScriptFactory` address must be registered as allowed EVMScript factory.

Evens:

```solidity
event MotionCreated(
    uint256 indexed _motionId,
    address _creator,
    address indexed _evmScriptFactory,
    bytes _evmScriptCallData,
    bytes _evmScript
)
```

#### function enactMotion(uint256 \_motionId, bytes memory \_evmScriptCallData) external whenNotPaused

If a motion with a given id wasn't rejected or canceled and time passed from motion creation is greater than the duration of the motion, removes motion and executes script generated by the EVMScript factory associated with motion. To execute the EVMScript, EasyTrack recreates it with passed `_evmScriptCallData` params via EVMScript factory stored in `motion.evmScriptFactory` property. Transaction will fail if the hash of recreated EVMScript does not match `evmScriptHash` stored in motion.

Events:

```solidity=
event MotionEnacted(uint256 indexed _motionId)
```

#### function cancelMotion(uint256 \_motionId) external

Removes motion from list of active motions. Motion can be canceled only by the creator of motion.

Events:

```solidity=
event MotionCanceled(uint256 indexed _motionId);
```

#### function objectToMotion(uint256 \_motionId) external

Submits an objection from `governanceToken` holder. The objection power equals the number of tokens held. Since `governanceToken` is MiniMeToken, it utilizes `balanceOfAt` and `totalSupplyAt` methods to prevent multiple objections submitted with the same tokens. If `objectionsThreshold` has been reached, the motion will be deleted and `MotionRejected` event will be emitted.

Events:

```solidity=
event ObjectionSent(
    uint256 indexed _motionId,
    address indexed _voterAddress,
    uint256 _weight,
    uint256 _votingPower
)
event MotionRejected(uint256 indexed _motionId)
```

#### function cancleMotions(uint256[] memory \_motionIds) external onlyRole(CANCEL_ROLE)

Cancels each motion with id contained in the `_motionIds` array. Can be called only by address granted with `CANCEL_ROLE`. If some of the passed ids don't exist, skips them. Emits `MotionCanceled` event for each canceled motion.

Events:

```solidity=
event MotionCanceled(uint256 indexed _motionId);
```

#### function cancelAllMotions() external onlyRole(CANCEL_ROLE)

Cancels all active motions. Can be called only by address granted with `CANCEL_ROLE` permission. Emits events `MotionCanceled` for each canceled motion.

Events:

```solidity=
event MotionCanceled(uint256 indexed _motionId);
```

#### function setEVMScriptExecutor(address \_evmScriptExecutor) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)

Sets new EVMScriptExecutor. Can be called only by Admin of Easy Track.

Events:

```solidity=
emit EVMScriptExecutorChanged(address indexed _evmScriptExecutor)
```

#### function pause() external whenNotPaused onlyRole(PAUSE_ROLE)

#### function getMotions() external view returns (Motion[] memory)

Returns list of motions not enacted and not canceled yet.

#### function getMotion(uint256 \_motionId) external view returns (Motion memory)

Returns motion with the given id.

#### function canObjectToMotion(uint256 \_motionId, address \_objector) external view returns (bool)

Returns if an `_objector` can submit an objection to motion with id equals to `_motionId` or not.

## EVMScriptExecutor

Contains method to execute EVMScripts. Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract. EVMScript uses format of Aragon's [CallsScript](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/evmscript/executors/CallsScript.sol) executor. The next grammar describes EVMScript:

```
EVM_SCRIPT       -> SPEC_ID | SPEC_ID EVM_SCRIPTS_LIST
EVM_SCRIPTS_LIST -> EVM_SCRIPT_ITEM | EVM_SCRIPTS_LIST
EVM_SCRIPT_ITEM  -> ADDRESS CALLDATA_LENGTH CALLDATA
SPEC_ID          -> uint32
ADDRESS          -> address
CALLDATA_LENGTH -> uint32
CALLDATA        -> bytes of length CALLDATA_LENGTH
```

### Methods

#### function executeEVMScript(bytes memory \_evmScript) external returns (bytes memory)

Executes passed EVMScripts and returns empty bytes as a result. This method might be called only by the EasyTrack contract. Current realization uses deployed contract of Aragon's default [CallsScript.sol](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v4.0.0/contracts/evmscript/executors/CallsScript.sol) executor. `EVMScriptExecutor.executeEVMScript` makes delegate call to `CallsScript.execScript` and returns the result of its execution(`CallsScript` always returns empty byte array on success) if the call was successful or reverts with error forwarded from `CallsScript.execScript` in other cases.

Events:

```solidity=
event ScriptExecuted(address indexed _caller, bytes _evmScript)
```

#### function setEasyTrack(address \_easyTrack) external onlyOwner

Sets new address of EasyTrack. Validates that `_easyTrack` is a contract. Can be called only by the owner of the contract.

Events:

```solidity=
event EasyTrackChanged(address indexed _previousEasyTrack, address indexed _newEasyTrack)
```

## IEVMScriptFactory

Interface which every EVMScript factory used in EasyTrack contract has to implement.

### Methods

#### function createEVMScript(address \_creator, bytes \_evmScriptCallData) external returns (bytes)

Creates new EVMScript using passed arguments. The method might apply validations or checks before creation and reverts with an error if some requirements haven't been fulfilled. EasyTrack contract uses `msg.sender` as value for `_creator` argument when called in create method, and `motion.creator` value when called in enact method.
